<h1>Description<h1>
<h4>We have 3 vending machines with five products per each (Cookies, Chocolate, Drink, Sandwich and Candies). Each product has a name, price and ID. Each machine has an amount of products and  a different amount of money (for the change management).
There are different types of money: Bills (20€, 10€ and 5€) and coins (2€, 1€, 0.5€, 0.2 and 0.05€).
The project simulates the buying/selling of the user managing the user money, the machine money, the change, the amount of products in the machine.
The project keeps in mind the possible failures and jams that might occur during the operation.<h4>
